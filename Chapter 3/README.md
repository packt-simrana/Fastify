# Chapter 3 - Working with Routes

In this chapter we will learn to expose routes to our application, and how to manage them.
We will understand how the Fastify's router works and how to configure it.

The example we will use is a simple test routes to become confidend with the Fastify's syntax and execution, so HAVE FUN!
